Eat-Da-Burger

This application is a way for customers to request which burgers they would like to see on the menu.
Whenever a new burger idea is submitted, it is logged into a MySQL database and then displayed on the page.

Note: This information is not yet able to be displayed as there is a bug in my code. I am working on correcting this.
